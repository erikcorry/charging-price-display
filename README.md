# Eco Power Swich

Program in [Toit](https://toitlang.org/) to show the electricty price for
the next 12 hours in Denmark.  This is also a good
proxy for the greenness of the electricity, as the price is largely determined
by the amount of wind and solar power available.

Thanks to https://www.elprisenligenu.dk/ for the free electricity
price API.

Runs on an [Lilygo](https://www.lilygo.cc/products/lilygo%C2%AE-ttgo-t-display-1-14-inch-lcd-esp32-control-board)-based
mini-display.
Should be easy to adapt to a different ESP32-based display.
